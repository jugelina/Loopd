A centralized app for clubs/organizations to post their events (similar to WildcatSYNC but more for students by students)
Each club/organization gets their own platform with media that they can plug in like videos, pictures, posts, highlights, etc. to create hype 
When students sign up they can “share their interests” by selecting areas of interest and then the app recommends clubs/organizations at their school 
Super accessible 
Notifications for all events
If clubs are more “exclusive” then they can have an option where students can email to join instead of just clicking join on their page or “join codes” where you can follow an organization but without a join code you can’t see everything 
Members only page where you can only see posts if you’re a part of the club: this can work for pregames and “private” parties “You’ve Been Invited….”
Clubs/organizations have access to all names of their followers and they can create an “attendance” sheet based on that so they can check off who actually attended the event 
Unfollowing can turn off notifications from that organization and make the app “less annoying” 
“Action buttons” you can RSVP, Add to Calendar, Set a reminder etc. and a “follow” button on the organization 

Social media adjacent platform
Organizations can “post” after their events with pictures and people can comment/like the post 
“Hot This Week Page” 
One week at a time platform 
Instagram adjacent 
“Stories” you can click through 
You’re involved! Type of reward system to encourage student involvement and participation (for later) 
You can get “badges” for being really involved or having higher positions in clubs 
You get something out of having 100 badges or something 

Two types of accounts: admin/club leaders and students
Someone can switch back and forth between admin and student accounts
